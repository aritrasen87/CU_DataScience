Why Python?

Python is a general purpose – open source, easy to learn language which now being used in various field like –

- Data Science - Numpy , Pandas , matplotlib , Sci-Py , Scikit Learn
- Deep Learning - Tensforflow , Pytorch , Keras
- Web development - Django
- Web development - Django
- Web scrapping - BeautifulSoup
- Game development and this list is never ending.

Along with this Python has a number of standard libraries which makes life of a programmer much easier since you don’t have to write all the code yourself. For example to call a web-service in Python you need to write hardly 4/5 lines of code.

Or by using scikit learn library you can create robust data science model very easily.
